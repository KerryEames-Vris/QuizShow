# Quizshow

## Description
I wanted to make a quiz you could take on some subject I hadn't actually decided on but when I sat down for it all the concepts mixed together in my mind and I couldn't make a single function work. It's supposed to start a timer and then make you answer several questions. It would record your score and your initials.

## Installation
1. Select the clone option from the repository page and copy the SSH link.
2. Navigate your terminal of choice to the directory you'd like the repository to be stored in.
3. Enter "git clone " and paste the copied SSH link into the terminal and run the command.
4. Open the HTML and JS files using your preferred code editing software

## Usage
This was just meant to be a fun quiz that you could record your results on to compete with others
